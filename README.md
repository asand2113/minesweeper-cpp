# minesweeper-cpp
## Overview
A simplistic, terminal-based Minesweeper game made in C++. Originally, this program was designed for a university course. Its overall simplistic nature and abundant code comments make it a good example for C++ learners to look over.

Make is used to build the program.

Notably, the project utilises ncurses and pthreads.
## Controls
Both a mouse and keyboard are required to play this version. Game controls are bound to specific buttons and can not be remapped. 
```
Left CLick - Reveal an unrevealed tile
Right Click - Toggle a tile's "flagged" status
q - Exit the game
```
